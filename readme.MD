# Lisp Parentheses Checker

A node program. This program is run from the command line like so:

```
npm run start .\mocks\MOCK_DATA.csv out
```

or

```
node index.js .\mocks\MOCK_DATA.csv out
```

The first argument for the program is the file to convert and the second argument is what folder to put it in. Leave that argument blank if you want the program to output files in the current working directory.

To run tests, type `npm run test` in the command line. Mocha is the test library.
